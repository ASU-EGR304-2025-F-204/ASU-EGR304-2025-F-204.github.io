Through this, we established that Aaron would do a computer animation of the project as one of the concept sketches, as he has familiarity with computer animation. We also established that Roshan would create a CAD model of a concept design that we could take. We decided to leave the last concept sketch up to Caleb, as we would discuss roles with him at a later time in person. We decided that Quinn would document the meetings, as well as any communication that occurred for documentation. This establishment, prior to a more in-depth discussion, was essential to most efficiently completing each of the assigned steps in a way that minimized chaos or confusion.</p> <p>In order to efficiently get these 100 features, we individually noted topics relevant to the user requirements already established in our section on Product Requirements; overlap in individually noted topics allowed us to more easily rank our ideas. We then shared these topics over Google Sheets and in our discussion, and went one by one through them, rapid-firing any idea related to the topic in order to quickly get many ideas and features, and not leave anybody out. Although we were unable to establish all 100 features in one meeting, it made sense to wait to finish discussing possible features or solutions until Caleb was present, so we could get equal contributions from everybody.</p> <p>In our second meeting, Caleb, Quinn, and Aaron met and finished establishing possible features and were able to further discuss workloads. Caleb\u2019s concept was established, and he thereafter decided to make a schematic drawing for it.</p> <p>The group was also briefly able to meet on Wednesday during class, but most of the rest of the important communication was completed over text and email.

This was the most significant issue, as the hierarchy of who overrides who, what systems should work together, etc. should be determined and implemented, else the system not work. Although somewhat simple to solve (just make it clear which code has priority), it prevented the systems from functioning cohesively.</li> <li>Jitter - A problem that arrived both from hardware and software issues was a lack of smoothness from some systems. This was both due to a lack of bypass/decoupling capacitors and unrefined code. Though it was too late to alter capacitors (since that's hardware), refining the code was necessary to making a high quality system.</li> <li>Responsiveness - The light sensor system would be largely unresponsive for around 5 seconds after it turned on, which was suboptimal for a system that's supposed to be sleek and feel easy to use. This was fixed by refining the code to have less delay and determine inputs more quickly.</li> <li>Outputs - Seeing as out group had never done anything this complex before, how to properly configure the system so that output voltages would optimally apply to each component was something that needed adjusting. At times, removing an LED was necessary and had little to no effect on the final product, or simply adjusting output values or resistance levels could resolve the issue.</li> <li>Intuitiveness - Many of the system's softwares were unintuitive and therefore somewhat difficult to adjust, especially in combination with needing to be applied to other team members' softwares at the same time. Simply having a teammate go through and ask questions, therefore allowing the programmer to add notes or simplify when needed, was all that was required for this issue to be resolved.</li> </ol>"},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#references","title":"References","text":"<p>Curiosity Nano hardware user guide</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/","title":"Software Design","text":""},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Our software design shows how the ClapSense system makes decisions and runs its internal processes.

In our current design each subsystem functions independently and sends a simple signal to the Hub. The Audio Front-End outputs a digital clap detection signal, the Light Sensor sends a digital high or low value based on ambient brightness, and the Distance Sensor Front-End outputs an analog voltage for LED brightness. The Hub software then reads these three inputs and makes the final decision about turning the motor on or off and adjusting the LED brightness. This approach works, but the software in Version 2.0 could take much better advantage of the hardware and create a more synchronized and reliable overall system.</p> <p>One improvement would be standardizing the signal processing across the sensing boards so the Hub receives cleaner and more consistent information. Right now each board interprets its own sensor in its own way, and the Hub has to assume the signals are correct. In a Version 2.0 design we could refine the Audio Front-End software to provide not just a raw clap flag but also confidence levels or filtered metrics that make clap detection more robust. The Light Sensor Front-End could provide a scaled brightness value instead of a simple high or low output, giving the Hub more context for deciding when to activate the system. The Distance Front-End could support built in smoothing or classification so the Hub does not need to process noisy ADC readings. These changes would make the system more accurate and better aligned with our team requirement of reducing false triggers and ensuring predictable behavior in different environments.</p> <p>Another major improvement would involve timing and synchronization. In Version 1 each subsystem updates its output continuously and independently, and the Hub polls them in a loop. This can lead to small inconsistencies in when each signal changes. Version 2.0 could establish a shared update rate or a trigger mechanism so that all subsystems refresh their outputs at predictable intervals. The Hub could then run its state machine with the confidence that all three inputs represent a consistent snapshot of the environment. This improvement would help us meet the performance requirement of responding to a clap within two hundred milliseconds while avoiding situations where one subsystem lags behind the others.</p> <p>We would also redesign the Hub software to use a clearer and more expressive state machine. In Version 1 the Hub simply checks whether a clap occurred and whether the light sensor is covered. In Version 2.0 we could introduce states such as Listening, Verifying, Active, and Cooldown. These states would let the Hub combine information from the Audio, Light, and Distance boards in smarter ways. For example, the Hub could ignore claps when the distance sensor shows that no one is near the device or require multiple confirmation checks from the Audio Front-End before activating the motor. This would directly support our requirements for accuracy, safety, and usability.</p> <p>Finally, Version 2.0 would benefit from better system wide debugging and calibration. Only the Hub currently outputs information over UART, and it is mostly used to display the distance ADC value. A future version could unify debugging so that the Hub reports audio thresholds, light sensor values, and distance readings together. Users or teammates could then adjust sensitivity or brightness mapping without editing the firmware on each board. This would make the entire system easier to tune and would help us meet our requirement for simple setup and consistent performance.</p> <p>Overall, Version 2.0 would not completely change the purpose of any subsystem, but it would improve how they cooperate. The Audio Front-End would provide richer clap information, the Light Sensor would offer more environmental context, the Distance Front-End would deliver cleaner and more stable data, and the Hub would coordinate everything through a smarter state machine. These changes would make the software more reliable, more accurate, and better aligned with the team\u2019s product requirements.</p>"},{"location":"07-Software%20Design/#references","title":"References","text":"<ul> <li>Curiosity Nano hardware user guide</li> </ul>"},{"location":"08-Resources/","title":"08 Resources","text":""},{"location":"09-Reflection/","title":"09 Reflection","text":"<p>Upon working on this project each member learned various concepts such as navigating MPLAB X IDE for coding a Nano Microchip as well as learning that we are able to connect each others subsystems through sharing a ground connection and by connecting our output signals.
