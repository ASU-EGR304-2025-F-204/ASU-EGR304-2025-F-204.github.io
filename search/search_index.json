Through this, we established that Aaron would do a computer animation of the project as one of the concept sketches, as he has familiarity with computer animation. We also established that Roshan would create a CAD model of a concept design that we could take. We decided to leave the last concept sketch up to Caleb, as we would discuss roles with him at a later time in person. We decided that Quinn would document the meetings, as well as any communication that occurred for documentation. This establishment, prior to a more in-depth discussion, was essential to most efficiently completing each of the assigned steps in a way that minimized chaos or confusion. In order to efficiently get these 100 features, we individually noted topics relevant to the user requirements already established in our section on Product Requirements; overlap in individually noted topics allowed us to more easily rank our ideas. We then shared these topics over Google Sheets and in our discussion, and went one by one through them, rapid-firing any idea related to the topic in order to quickly get many ideas and features, and not leave anybody out. Although we were unable to establish all 100 features in one meeting, it made sense to wait to finish discussing possible features or solutions until Caleb was present, so we could get equal contributions from everybody.</p> <p>In our second meeting, Caleb, Quinn, and Aaron met and finished establishing possible features and were able to further discuss workloads. Caleb\u2019s concept was established, and he thereafter decided to make a schematic drawing for it.</p> <p>The group was also briefly able to meet on Wednesday during class, but most of the rest of the important communication was completed over text and email.
