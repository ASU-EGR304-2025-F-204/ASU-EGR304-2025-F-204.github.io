## Team Goals

1. Deliver a functional embedded system that meets or exceeds the project requirements and demonstrates reliable performance under testing.

2. Maintain consistent communication through agreed-upon channels (e.g., text  messaging, email, or weekly meetings) to keep everyone aligned and avoid last-minute surprises.

3. Leverage individual strengths by assigning roles and responsibilities that balance skills, encourage learning, and share workload fairly.

4. Develop professional engineering documentation (clear reports, diagrams, and well-commented code) that reflects industry standards and supports future maintainability.

5. Foster a collaborative and respectful team culture where every member feels supported, accountable, and empowered to contribute ideas.

## Meeting Coordination

1. What method will you use to remind yourselves of meetings (a shared calendar?) 

We will utilize the ASU canvas announcements in our group section in order to keep meeting reminders within canvas. We will also make sure to communicate via text, as well via email or instagram.

1. How will your team go about changing or adding meeting times?

Communication is key, so we'll always let the whole team know beforehand via an afformentioned method.

1. What's the preferred format for meetings (face-to-face or virtually)?

Face-to-face is definitely prefferable and easily available with our schedules, but if needed we can always do a group call, zoom, discord, etc.

1. Are there any other procedures that your team feels are necessary?

Good communication is going to always be the key to a team where everyone feels heard, so prioritizing good scheduling as far as meeting location, time, etc. is essential.
