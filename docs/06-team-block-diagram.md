title: Team Block Diagram
---

## Introduction

Our team designed a hub-and-spoke block diagram for the clap-activated smart light project. The Master Controller (Caleb) serves as the Hub, coordinating signals from the Audio Front-End (Aaron), Output Driver (Roshan), and UI/Status Board (Quinn). Each board is based on the PIC18F57Q43 Curiosity Nano and communicates via an 8-pin ribbon cable standard.

## Research Question

* How can we design a modular clap-activated smart light using distributed microcontrollers?
* Which subsystem should handle audio filtering, user interaction, and lamp switching for best reliability?
* How can the hub coordinate signals with minimal false triggers?

## Results

1. The system is organized using a hub-and-spoke model, with Calebâ€™s board as the central controller.
2. Each teammate has one subsystem: audio input, output driver, UI/status, and system coordination.
3. The 8-pin ribbon connector standard ensures consistent power, ground, and communication lines across all boards.
