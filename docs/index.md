## Team Introduction
Team 204 is a group of engineering students who share the goal of designing a reliable and easy-to-use clap-activated smart light. Each member brings unique skills to the table, and together we created a modular system that connects multiple boards into one cohesive design. This hub-and-spoke setup allows our project to operate efficiently, with clear communication between the controller, audio input, output driver, and user interface.

As a team, we value collaboration, creativity, and clear communication. We are motivated by the idea that engineering should make everyday life easier and more accessible. Our project reflects that goal by transforming a simple clap into a dependable and modern way to control light.
