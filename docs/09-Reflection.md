title: Reflection
---
Upon working on this project each member learned various concepts such as:
* Navigating MPLAB X IDE and MCC Melody
* Learning that we are able to connect each others subsystems through sharing a ground connection and by connecting our output signals
* Learning how to navigate Kicad to create a schematic with custom symbols
* Creating a high quality corresponding PCB schematic with custom footprints
* Something being complex does not make it good
* Efficent wire management
* Soldering a PCB (or anything)
* Debugging hardware through use of an oscilliscope and/or multimeter
* Coding a microcontroller
* The difference between different types of pins (PWM, ADC, DAC, etc.)


For future students:
1. Ask others for help. Trust me, nobody knows what they're doing, so if you find someone who does dont be afraid to ask questions.
2. Helping other students if you feel like you have somewhat of a grasp on something is essential to improving that understanding. Maybe you'll come across a problem that you didn't have--but maybe solving that problem will help you in the future.
3. Do the labs before class. Dont get caught off guard by the hardest lab of all time... you'll get a zero.
4. If your system isn't outputting a signal, use a multimeter and check for power between components in case one component is fried and needs to be replaced.
5. Use as minimal an amount of wires as possible (this makes it easier to follow and therefore debug).
