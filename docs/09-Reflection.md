Upon working on this project each member learned various concepts such as navigating MPLAB X IDE for coding a Nano Microchip as well as learning that we are able to connect each others subsystems through sharing a ground connection and by connecting our output signals. We also learned how to navigate Kicad to create a schematic with custom symbols and a corresponding PCB schematic with custom footprints.
