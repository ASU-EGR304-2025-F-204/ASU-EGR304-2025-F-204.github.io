Upon working on this project each member learned various concepts such as navigating MPLAB X IDE for coding a Nano Microchip as well as learning that we are able to connect each others subsystems through sharing a ground connection and by connecting our output signals. We also learned how to navigate Kicad to create a schematic with custom symbols and a corresponding PCB schematic with custom footprints. 


For future students:
1. If your system isn't outputting a signal, use a multimeter and check for power between components in case one component is fried and needs to be replaced.
